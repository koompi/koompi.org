      <description>On April 26, 2020, We have released a new ISO version for KOOMPI OS (the built number: 202004) with many new cool features and even the bugs have been fixed. We have been working very hard to push out the OTA update. If you are curious about this new version, you can download and install the ISO with the link that has been providing below. However, If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to set up it, you can come to the KOOMPI Office for installation anytime you are free.</description>

      <description>Pix sounds familiar to pi but it is quite different because it stands for pacman extended or extra which is supported by many more applications which Pi can’t do. So, Our team has been trying to create this function in case users want to install some apps which our OS officially support yet. After you installed pix or you are in pix version, you still can use pi as normal.</description>
