Feb 16 13:00:18 server httpd[1067]: AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably dete...ge Hint: Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full. Test Apache First, Let create a sample page in the Apache root directory. For Example: \/srv\/http.\nnano \/srv\/http\/index.html Add the following line:\n\x26lt;html\x26gt; \x26lt;title\x26gt;Welcome\x26lt;\/title\x26gt; \x26lt;body\x26gt; Welcome to OSTechNix test page \x26lt;\/html\x26gt; Now, open your web browser and navigate to http:\/\/localhost or http:\/\/IP-address. You will be pleased with Apache server Test page.\nExtent Details To set Apache to start at boot:\nsudo systemctl enable httpd.service To make a backup:\ncp \/etc\/httpd\/conf\/extra\/httpd-mpm.conf ~\/httpd-mpm.conf.backup  Before changing any configuration files, it is advised that you make a backup of the file.\n  MariaDB Or MySql Run the following command to install MariaDB:\npi -S mysql After you run the command above, you will be asked whether to install MariaDB or Percona server, just hit enter and then type “Y” and press enter again. The default selection i.e MariaDB will be installed on your KOOMPI OS and the output will be like this,\n[koompi@koompi-pc ~]$ sudo pacman -S mysql :: There are 2 providers available for mysql: :: Repository extra 1) mariadb :: Repository community 2) percona-server You need to initialize the MariaDB data directory prior to starting the service. To do so, run:\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=\/usr --datadir=\/var\/lib\/mysql Then issue the following command to enable and start MariaDB service.\nsystemctl enable mysqld systemctl start mysqld You can verify whether MariaDb is running or not using command:\nsystemctl status mysqld Setup MySQL\/MariaDB root user password As you may know, It is recommended to setup a password for database root user.\nRun the following command to setup MariaDB root user password:\nmysql_secure_installation  MariaDB has been installed and ready to use. PHP\n To install PHP in Arch Linux, run:\npi -S php php-apache  Then PHP is installed, we need to configure Apache PHP module.\n To do so, edit \/etc\/httpd\/conf\/httpd.conf file,\nsudo nano \/etc\/httpd\/conf\/httpd.conf Find the following line and comment it out:\n[...] #LoadModule mpm_event_module modules\/mod_mpm_event.so [...] Then, add the following lines at the bottom, Save and close the file.:\n[...] LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules\/mod_mpm_prefork.so LoadModule php7_module modules\/libphp7.so AddHandler php7-script php Include conf\/extra\/php7_module.conf Testing PHP Now create a test.php file in the Apache root directory.\nsudo nano \/srv\/http\/test.php Add the following lines:\n\x26lt;?php phpinfo(); ?\x26gt; Restart httpd service. systemctl restart httpd  Open up your web browser and navigate to http:\/\/ip-address\/test.php\n  </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",
