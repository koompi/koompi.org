							label: "<p>On Open-source software most applications are installed through Aur that contain app package.So, Here are the details for installing and removing packages details.\n  Installing Packages Follow the following command to install a signal package including the dependencies:\n pi -S \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; or pi -i \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; For the list of packages installation:\n pi -S \u0026lt;Package name1 Package name2 ...\u0026gt;  Installing Package Group Some packages belong to a group of packages that simultaneously call installation. As in here, for instance\n pi -S \u0026lt;Package group name\u0026gt; To see what inside the package group, run\n pi -Sg \u0026lt;Package group name\u0026gt;  Removing Packages A package is always installed with other packages that it depends on, called dependencies. Quite often those dependencies are already, or partially installed on your system because other packages also depend on it.\nIf you just want to remove the package, the command following will be enough\n pi -R \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; If you rather want to avoid a cluttered system you can remove a package and its dependencies, without removing dependencies that are used by other installed packages, use the following command.\n pi -Rs \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; To remove a package, its dependencies and all the packages that depend on the target package\n pi -Rsc \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; For deleting a package that other packages need without deleting their dependency package\n pi -Rdd \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt;  All operations have required a password. Then if you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your operation.\n Here Special usage to automate the install procedure (Recommend):\n  yes | pi -S \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt;  Install packages with no confirm.\n  pi -S --noconfirm \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt;  </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

							label: "<p>This document is a guide for information related to Files and Folders. All the Command lines will be provided here with the explanation plus the example.\nFor more details of the instruction, see KOOMPI OS website articles or the various program section, both linked from this guide.\n  Create File Knowing how to create a new file is an important skill for anyone using open-source regularly. You can create a new file either from the command line or from the desktop file manager.\nThe touch command allows us to update the timestamps on existing files and directories as well as creating, empty files. The only easiest and most memorable way to create new, empty files is by using the touch command.\nTo create a new file simply run the touch command followed by the name of the file you want to create:\n touch Files_Name.txt You can also create multiple files at once by specifying the file names separated by space.\n touch File_Name1.txt File_Name2.txt File_Name3.txt  .txt stand for the text file. You can also use other extensions for the kind of files you want to use.\n Besides Touch, echo can also use to create file too. The echo command prints the strings that are passed as arguments to the standard output, which can be redirected to a file.\n echo \u0026quot;some line\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; File_Name.txt For Example:\n echo $null \u0026gt;\u0026gt; sample.txt  $null here is standing for no. It means there will be no arguments redirected into the file.\n Deleting File Deleting File is one of the frequently done operation. Run rm command with the name of the file you want to remove:\n rm File_Name Here is an example\n rm sample.txt Display File Content Cat(concatenate) command is very frequently used in open-source. It reads data from the file and gives their content as output. It helps us to create, view, concatenate files. So let us see some frequently used cat commands.\n cat File_Name Edit Text File There are many ways to edit files through command line such as vi, emacs, pico, ed, and nano. Among those only Nano is regularly using.\n nano File_Name  Sometimes, we need to add sudo; which stand for superuser do, in front of it to edit.\n  sudo nano File_Name Copy File or Folder A basic example of the cp command to copy files (keep the original file and make a duplicate of it) might look like:\n cp File_Name NewFile_Name If you want to copy other file from one directory to other directory, you can use the command below:\ncp -R \u0026lt;source_folder\u0026gt; \u0026lt;destination_folder\u0026gt; Options -i for interactive, asks you to confirm if an existing file (perhaps a version of joe_expenses already exists in the cashflow directory) should be overwritten in the copying process.\n-r for recursive, to copy all the subdirectories and files in a given directory and preserve the tree structure.\n-v for verbose, shows files being copied one by one.\nMove\/Rename file or folder For instance, to instantly seek out and move all of the folder. Your command-line instruction would simply be:\n mv Folder_Name NewFolder_Name Create Folder we can create directories from command line using the command mkdir. Syntax of this command is explained below.\n mkdir Folder_Name For example, to create a folder named ‘newfolder‘ the command is:\n mkdir NewFolder Remove Folder Removing folder is like removing the file, too but it has a little bit different. You have to add -r after rm command.\n rm -r Folder_Name List Folder Contents Listing Command (ls) allows us to see all the contents in the directory we are in.\n ls Options    Options Descriptions     ls -a list all files including hidden file starting with \u0027.\u0027   ls \u0026ndash;color colored list [=always\/never\/auto]   ls -d list directories - with \u0027 *\/\u0027   ls -F add one char of *\/=\u0026gt;@| to enteries   ls -i list file\u0027s inode index number   ls -l list with long format - show permissions   ls -la list long format including hidden files   ls -lh list long format with readable file size   ls -ls list with long format with file size   ls -r list in reverse order   ls -R list recursively directory tree    For more info use --help after the command like this `ls \u0026ndash;help``.\nChange Folder or Directory cd is the command for changing the folder\/directory of the command line. Here its syntax:\n cd Folder_Name Changing to home directory (determined by $HOME environment variable):\n cd Also change to home directory:\n cd . Change to parent directory:\n cd .. Change to subdirectory Documents:\n cd Documents Change to directory with absolute path\n cd path1\/path2\/path3 Change to directory name with white space -path Name\n cd path\\ Name  \\ here is stand for white space !!!\n Show Current Folder To show the directory you are currently in:\n pwd Output :\n \/home\/koompi Create Physical Link to File or Folder To make links between files you need to use ln command. A symbolic link (also known as a soft link or symlink) consists of a special type of file that serves as a reference to another file or directory.\nln [FileName] [LinkName] Find Phrase Within File The grep command is used to search text. It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words. It is one of the most useful commands.\nBelow is some standard grep command explained with examples to get you started with grep. Search any line that contains the word in filename.\n grep \u0027Strings\u0027 FileName Perform a case-insensitive search for the word:\n grep -i \u0027Strings\u0027 FileName Looking for all files in the current directory and in all of its subdirectories.\n grep -R \u0027Strings\u0027 Searching and displaying the total number of times that the string appears in FileName.\n grep -c \u0027Strings\u0027 FileName Searching by paths:\n grep \u0027Strings\u0027 path\/path\/path Mount Filesystem You can mount the filesystem with the syntax below:\n mount \/dev\/[device] [path] Unmount Filesystem You can also unmount filesystem with command below.\n unmount [path] Make File Executable Change the rights to a file so that it can run as a program.\n chmod \u002bx filename List Trash Files As you have already known what is ls command, you should know the path of the trash file.\n ls -l files ~\/.local\/share\/Trash\/files Empty Trash Above are the paths of trash file, we can empty it with rm -r command:\n rm -r ~\/.locale\/share\/Trash   </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the screen.\nThe most popular browsers have several features in common. They allow users to set bookmarks and browse in a private mode. They also can be customized with extensions, and some of them provide a sync service.\n In this document, We will show you the details about some browsers and how to install some of those Web Browsers that are supported in KOOMPI OS.\nBefore continuing with this document, make sure you know how to use terminal or Konsole, first\nIn this chart list below is all the browser apps that KOOMPI OS is supported and with commands installation:\n   Browser Names Installing Command     Brave pi -S brave-bin   Chromium pi -S chromium   Firefox pi -S firefox   Google Chrome pi -S google-chrome   Midori pi -S midori   Opera pi -S opera   Thunderbird pi -S thunderbird     Brave Brave web browser is a fast, free and open-source software.It was invented for fighting malware and preventing from tracking while keeping your information safe and secured.\nBrave is the default apps that we use in our KOOMPI OS. And we recommend you guy to use it.\n How to install Brave There are various choices you can install brave.\nOpen terminal either via Ctrl\u002bAlt\u002bT keyboard shortcut or by searching for terminal or konsole from app launcher. When it opened, run the command below to install it:\n pi -S brave   pi -S brave-bin    It will require your password. Your password won\u0026rsquo;t appear on your screen and it is hidden so just typing it down.\n  Chromium Chromium browser is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all Internet users to experience the web.\nUnlike Chrome, Chromium does not automatically update itself. As a result, you will have to update your browser periodically to ensure you remain on top of the latest security updates and features as they are introduced.\n How to install Chromium If you are familiar with using commands, you can simply type this in the terminal:\npi -S chromium  Firefox Mozilla Firefox or simply called Firefox browser is the default web browser in many open-source Linux distributions and KOOMPI OS is one of them.\nHow to install firefox As I said before, Firefox is available in almost all the open-source distributions out there.\nIf that’s not the case, you should stick to the official package manager provided by your distribution for installing Firefox. That’s the easiest and best method.\nBefore installing any application, make sure your system is up to date!!!\n You can easily install firefox with only a command:\npi -S firefox  Google Chrome A Google Chrome App, or commonly just Chrome App, is a web application that runs on the Google Chrome web browser. Chrome apps can be obtained from the Chrome Web Store where apps, extensions, and themes can be installed or bought.\nHow to install Google Chrome In order to install chrome, all you need to know is its keyword like I have said before. So, the command you need to know it below:\npi -S google-chrome  Midori Midori browser is a lightweight yet powerful web browser which runs just as well on little embedded computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core temperature exceeding that of planet earth.\nFor Midori privacy has been a very important point since its birth for this reason it uses DuckDuckGo to ensure better privacy towards users.\nHow to install Midori Midori can be installed within only a command in konsole:\npi -S midori  Opera Opera is a freeware web browser for Microsoft Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, and open-source operating systems, developed by Opera Software.\nOpera is a Chromium-based browser using the Blink layout engine. It differentiates itself because of a distinct user interface and other features.\nHow to install Opera On open-source operating system, We can install opera through many ways. In KOOMPI OS, it has its way, too. You can install it by a command below:\npi -S opera  Thunderbird Mozilla Thunderbird is a free and open-source, cross-platform email client, news client, RSS, and chat client developed by the Mozilla Foundation.\nBefore you install Thunderbird, make sure that your computer has the required libraries installed. Missing libraries will cause Thunderbird to be inoperable.\n How to instal Thunderbird To install Thunderbird, we recommended you to install it from package manager.\npi -S thunderbird If you installed thunderbird from outside package manager, you have to make sure that you have installed all its relevant dependencies.\n If you face the problem with runnning app, please click here\n     </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

							value: "Cache Info",
							label: "<p>Pi stores its downloaded packages in \/var\/cache\/pacman\/pkg\/ and does not remove the old or uninstalled versions automatically. This has some advantages:\n It allows to downgrade a package without the need to retrieve the previous version through other means, such as the Arch Linux Archive. A package that has been uninstalled can easily be reinstalled directly from the cache folder, not requiring a new download from the repository.  However, it is necessary to deliberately clean up the cache periodically to prevent the folder to grow indefinitely in size.\nThe paccache script, provided within the pacman-contrib package, deletes all cached versions of installed and uninstalled packages, except for the most recent 3, by default:\npaccache -r Enable and start paccache.timer to discard unused packages weekly.\nYou can create a hook to run this automatically after every pi transaction.\n For more options aboout paccache use :\npaccache -h Pacman also has some built-in options to clean the cache and the leftover database files from repositories which are no longer listed in the configuration file \/etc\/pacman.conf.\nHowever, Pacman does not offer the possibility to keep a number of past versions and is, therefore, more aggressive than paccache default options.\nTo remove all the cached packages that are not currently installed, and the unused sync database, execute:\npi -Sc To remove all files from the cache, use the clean switch twice, this is the most aggressive approach and will leave nothing in the cache folder:\npi -Scc  One should avoid deleting from the cache all past versions of installed packages and all uninstalled packages unless one desperately needs to free some disk space. This will prevent downgrading or reinstalling packages without downloading them again.\n Automatically clean the package cache.\n If you are too lazy to clean the package cache manually, you can automate this task using Pacman hooks. The Pacman hook will automatically clean the package cache after every Pacman transaction.\nTo do so, create a file \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks\/clean_package_cache.hook:\nsudo mkdir \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks Next:\nsudo nano \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks\/clean_package_cache.hook Add the following lines:\n[Trigger] Operation = Upgrade Operation = Install Operation = Remove Type = Package Target = * [Action] Description = Cleaning pacman cache... When = PostTransaction Exec = \/usr\/bin\/paccache -r Save and close the file. From now on, the package cache will be cleaned automatically after every Pacman transactions (like an upgrade, install, remove).

							value: "Link\/Unlink",
							label: "<p>To make links between files you need to use ln command. A symbolic link (also known as a soft link or symlink) consists of a special type of file that serves as a reference to another file or directory.\nln is a command-line utility for creating links between files.By default, the ln command creates hard links. To create a symbolic link, use the -s (--symbolic) option.\nThere are two types of links in Linux\/UNIX systems:\n  Hard links: You can think a hard link as an additional name for an existing file. Hard links are associating two or more file names with the same inode. You can create one or more hard links for a single file.\n  Soft links: A soft link is something like a shortcut in Windows. It is an indirect pointer to a file or directory. Unlike a hard link, a symbolic link can point to a file or a directory on a different filesystem or partition.\n  Hard links cannot be created for directories and files on a different filesystem or partition.\n   Syntax The ln command syntax for creating symbolic links is as follows:\nln -s [OPTIONS] FILE LINK Create Hard Link That\u0026rsquo;s pretty straightforward - all you have to do is to use the ln command in the following way:\nln [file] [hard-link-to-file] Sample:\nln test.txt test_hard_link.txt Create Symbolic Link Soft links are created with the ln command. For example, the following would create a soft link named link to a file named file, both in the current directory\nln -s \u0026lt;File\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; To verify new soft link run:\nls -l file link Output:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 veryv wheel 0 Mar 7 22:01 file lrwxr-xr-x 1 veryv wheel 5 Mar 7 22:01 link -\u0026gt; file1 From the above outputs it is clear that a symbolic link named ‘link’ contains the name of the file named ‘file’ to which it is linked.\nOverwrite\/Remove Existing Destination You can make ln override this behavior by using the -f command line option.\nln -f \u0026lt;File\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; You can use the -i command line option if you want to make all this deletion process interactive.\nln -i \u0026lt;File\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; Delete Linked There are some other things that you should consider when you need to delete links or the files to which they point.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s delete every hard link first by command rm . Remember that every directory entry that points to an inode is simply a hard link.\n By the way, you can use unlink to delete linked,too.\nunlink file  For more option or flags, using \u0026ndash;help to show.\n   </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

							label: "<p>Network is included by two or more computers that are linked to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. NetworkManager is the configuration of the network on the interfaces, which is the software utility that aims to simplify the use of computer networks.\n  Check the connection To ensure about the network connection, go through the following conditions below:\n Your network interface is listed and enabled. Otherwise, check the device driver. Making sure that you are connected with a network cable or connected to the wireless LAN. Your network interface has an IP Address. You can ping a local IP Address (e.g. The default gateway.) You can also ping a public IP Address(e.g. The google DNS server).  Reset Network Manager Service This is the easiest way to restart your network using the command line. It’s equivalent to the graphical way of doing it (restarts the Network-Manager service).\nsudo service network-manager restart  The network icon should disappear for a moment and then reappear.\n Reset Systemd of Network Manager The service command is just a wrapper for this method (and also for init.d scripts and Upstart commands). The systemctl command is much more versatile than service. This is what I usually prefer.\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service  The network icon (again) should disappear for a moment. To check out other systemctl options, you can refer to its man page.\n Turn OFF and ON Network Manager This is yet another tool for handling networks. It is a pretty powerful tool that you can find it very practical. Many sysadmins prefer it since it is easy to use.\nThere are two steps to this method: turning the network off, and then turning it back on.\nsudo nmcli networking off  The network will shut down and the icon will disappear. To turn it back on.\n sudo nmcli networking on  You can check out the man page of nmcli for more options.\n Ping address Ping has been used as the command for testing if you have reach to a host or not.\nping www.example.com Down here is the example:\nkoompi@koompi-os$~ ping www.google.com PING www.google.com (172.217.194.147) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 172.217.194.147: icmp_seq=1 ttl=109 time=32.3 ms 64 bytes from 172.217.194.147: icmp_seq=2 ttl=109 time=33.6 ms 64 bytes from 172.217.194.147: icmp_seq=3 ttl=109 time=33.5 ms  If you receive an error like pingL icmp open socket: Operation not permitted when executing ping, try to re-install iputils package.\n IP Address An Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication.\nAn IP address serves two main functions:\n The host or Network interface identification The location addressing.  Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number.\nTo discover which IP addresses your computer has, you use the ip command with the object address.The default action is show, which lists the IP addresses. You can also omit show and abbreviate address as \u0026ldquo;addr\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;.\nThe following commands are all equivalent:  ip address show   ip addr show   ip addr   ip a    The output is down below:\n1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link\/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1\/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: wlan0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qle link\/ether 34:41:5d:83:dd:fd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.10.107\/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0 valid_lft 5938sec preferred_lft 5938sec inet6 fe80::ba0c:6781:2174:12f4\/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever We can see two IP addresses, along with a lot of other information. The IP addresses are associated with the network interface controller(NICs). The ip command tries to be helpful and provides a bunch of information about the interface, too.\nThe first IP address is the (internal) loopback address used to communicate within the computer. The second is the actual (external) IP address the computer has on the local area network (LAN).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break down all the information we received:\n  lo: The network interface name as a string.\n  \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt;: This is a loopback interface. It is UP, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s operation. The Physical networking layer(layer one) is also up.\n  mtu 65536: The maximum transfer unit. This is the size of the largest chunk of data this interface can transmit.\n  qdisc noqueue: A qdisc is a queuing mechanism. It schedules the transmission of packets. There are different queuing techniques called disciplines. The noqueue discipline means “send instantly, don’t queue.” This is the default qdisc discipline for virtual devices, such as the loopback address.\n  state UNKNOWN: This can be DOWN (the network interface is not operational), UNKNOWN (the network interface is operational but nothing is connected), or UP (the network is operational and there is a connection).\n  group default: Interfaces can be grouped logically. The default is to place them all in a group called “default.”\n  qlen 1000: The maximum length of the transmission queue.\n  link\/loopback: The media access control (MAC) address of the interface.\n  inet 127.0.0.1\/8: The IP version 4 address. The part of the address after the forward-slash (\/) is Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation (CIDR) representing the subnet mask. It indicates how many leading contiguous bits are set to one in the subnet mask. The value of eight means eight bits. Eight bits set to one represents 255 in binary, so the subnet mask is 255.0.0.0.\n  scope host: The IP address scope. This IP address is only valid inside the computer (the “host”).\n  lo: The interface with which this IP address is associated.\n  valid_lft: Valid lifetime. For an IP version 4 IP address allocated by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), this is the length of time the IP address is considered valid and able to make and accept connection requests.\n  preferred_lft: Preferred lifetime. For an IP version 4 IP address allocated by DHCP, this is the amount of time the IP address can be used with no restrictions. This should never be larger than the valid_lft value.\n  \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt;: This interface supports broad- and multicasting, and the interface is UP (operational and connected). The hardware layer of the network (layer one) is also UP.\n  Display Only IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses If you want to limit the output to the IP version 4 addresses, you can use the -4 option, as follows:\nip -4 addr Output:\n1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: wlan0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 inet 192.168.10.107\/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0 valid_lft 4487sec preferred_lft 4487sec if you want to limit the output to the IP version 6 addresses, you can use the -6 option, as follows:\nip -6 addr Output:\n1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 state UNKNOWN qlen 1000 inet6 ::1\/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: wlan0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 state UP qlen 1000 inet6 fe80::ba0c:6781:2174:12f4\/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever Display Information for Single Interface If you want to see the IP address information for a single interface, you can use the show and dev options, and name the interface, as shown below.\nip addr show dev \u0026lt;Network_Interface_Name\u0026gt; For example:\nip addr show dev lo Output:\n1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link\/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1\/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever You can also use the -4 or -6 flag to further refine the output so you only see that in which you’re interested.\n Sample: If you want to see the IP version 4 information related to addresses on interface lo, type the following command.\nip -4 addr show dev lo Output:\n1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever Adding an IP Address You can use the add and dev options to add an IP address to an interface. You just have to tell the ip command which IP address to add, and to which interface to add it.\nWe’re going to add the IP address 192.168.4.44 to the lo interface. We also have to provide the CIDR notation for the subnet mask.\nWe type the following:\nsudo ip addr add 192.168.4.44\/24 dev lo The new IP Address is present on the network interface.\nWe can jump on another computer and use the following command to see if we can ping the new IP address.\n koompi@koompi-os$~ ping 192.168.4.44 PING 192.168.4.44 (192.168.4.44) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 192.168.4.44: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.039 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.4.44: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.092 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.4.44: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.109 ms The IP address responds and sends back acknowledgments to the pings. Our new IP address is up and running after one simple ip command.\nDeleting IP Address To delete an IP address, the command is almost the same as the one to add one, except you replace add with del, as shown below:\nsudo ip addr del 192.168.4.44\/24 dev lo Using IP With Network Interfaces You use the link object to inspect and work with network interfaces. Type the following command to see the interfaces installed on your computer:\nip link show 1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 link\/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 2: wlan0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000 link\/ether 34:41:5d:83:dd:fd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff To see a single network interface, just add its name to the command, as shown below:\nip link show \u0026lt;Network_Interface_Name\u0026gt; Sample:\nip link show lo Starting and Stopping Links You can use the set options with either up or down to stop or start network interface option. You can also have to use sudo (Super User), as shown below.\nsudo ip link set \u0026lt;Network_Interface_Name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;up or down\u0026gt; Sample:\nsudo ip link set lo down If you use the up option, your network interface will be restarted, and the state is shown as UP.\n Usinng IP With Routes With the route object, you can inspect and manipulate routes. Routes define to where network traffic to different IP addresses is forwarded, and through which network interface.\nIf the destination computer or device shares a network with the sending computer, the sending computer can forward the packet directly to it.\nHowever, if the destination device is not directly connected, the sending computer forwards the packet to the default router. The router then decides where to send the packet.\nTo see the routes defined on your computer, type the following command:\nip route Output:\ndefault via 192.168.10.1 dev wlan0 proto dhcp metric 600 192.168.10.0\/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.10.107 metric 600 Let’s take a look at the info we received:\n default: The default rule. This route is used if none of the other rules match what’s being sent. via 192.168.10.1: Routes the packets via the device at 192.168.10.1. This is the IP address of the default router on this network. dev wlan0: Use this network interface to send the packets to the router. proto dhcp: The routing protocol identifier. DHCP means the routes will be determined dynamically. metric 100: An indication of the preference of the route compared to others. Routes with lower metrics are preferentially used over those with higher metrics. You can use this to give preference to a wired network interface over a Wi-Fi one.  Display Information for Single Route If you want to focus on the details of a particular route, you can add the list option and IP address range of the route to the command as follows:\nip route list \u0026lt;ip_address\u0026gt; Adding Route We just added a new network interface card to this computer. We type the following and it\u0026rsquo;s showing up as wlan2:\nWe’ll add a new route to the computer to use this new interface. First, we type the following to associate an IP address with the interface:\nsudo ip addr add 192.168.121.1\/24 dev wlan2 A default route using the existing IP address is added to the new interface. We use the delete option, as shown below, to delete the route and provide its details:\nsudo ip route delete default via 192.168.4.1 dev wlan2 We’ll now use the add option to add our new route. The new interface will handle network traffic in the 192.168.121.0\/24 IP address range. We’ll give it a metric of 100; because it will be the only route handling this traffic, the metric is pretty much academic.\nWe type the following:\nsudo ip route add 192.168.121.0\/24 dev wlan2 metric 100 Now , typing ip route command to see what it gives. As our new route is now in place;however, we still have the 192.168.4.0\/24 route that points to interface enp0s8—we type the following to remove it:\nsudo ip route delete 192.168.4.0\/24 dev wlan2 We should now have a new route that points all traffic destined for IP range 192.168.121.0\/24 through interface wlan2. It should also be the only route that uses our new interface.\nTaken Route, Not Taken Root The great thing about these commands is they’re not permanent. If you want to clear them, just reboot your system. This means you can experiment with them until they work the way you want. And it’s a very good thing if you make a terrible mess of your system—a simple reboot will restore order.\nOn the other hand, if you want the changes to be permanent, you have to do some more work. Exactly what varies depending on the distribution family, but they all involve changing config files.\nThis way, though, you can test-drive commands before you make anything permanent.\n   \n</p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

							value: "Searching\/History",
							label: "<p>In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the commands and how you can quickly use it to locate files in your filesystem. Finding file is a powerful utility capable of locating files anywhere on your system including mounted drives and removable storage, processing regular expressions, and even running other commands on those files. Fortunately, only a few simple options are needed to provide most users with all the capability they need.\n  The find command is a command-line utility for walking a file hierarchy. It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions.\nFind File By Name As with most open-source commands, you have several available options. And we are attempting to find a file by name, we’ll use one of two options:\n name – case sensitive iname – case insensitive  Remember, Open-source is very particular about the case, so if you’re looking for a file named text.txt, the following command will return no results.\nsudo find \/ -name filename.extension Sample:\nsudo find \/ -name text.txt If, however, you were to alter the command by using the -iname option, the find command would locate your file, regardless of case. So the new command looks like:\nsudo find \/ -iname filename.extension Sample:\nsudo find \/ -iname text.txt Find By Type What if you’re not so concerned with locating a file by name but would rather locate all files of a certain type? Some of the more common file descriptors are:\n   Options Description     f Regular File   d Directory   l Symbolic Link   c Character Devices   b Block Devices    Now, suppose you want to locate all block devices (a file that refers to a device) on your system. With the help of the -type option, we can do that like so:\nsudo find \/ -type b We can use the same option to help us look for configuration files. Say, for instance, you want to locate all regular files that end in the .conf extension. This command would look something like:\nsudo find \/ -type f -name \u0026quot;*.conf\u0026quot; Find Modified Files Since Last 60 minutes Do you know you can modify your files by for the last 60 minutes or any minutes.\nfind \/ -mmin -60 Find Change Files Since Last 6 minutes You can also find the changed files that you have been changed for any minutes, too.\nfind \/ -cmin -60 Find All Files Which Are Accessed 7 days Besides finding all the files that have been changed by minutes you can look for the files has been accessed for days.\nfind \/ -atim 7  All the numeric number here, you can put with any other number.\n Finding Files By Size We can use the find command to locate files of a certain size. Say, for instance, you want to go large and locate files that are over 1000MB. The find command can be issued, with the help of the -size option, like so:\nfind \/ -size \u002b1000M You can also find all files which are greater than or less than, too. For example, ( Greater than 10MB Less than 100MB )\nfind \/ -size \u002b10M -size -10M With the output from the command, you can comb through the directory structure and free up space or troubleshoot to find out what is mysteriously filling up your drive.\nYou can search with the following size descriptions:\n   Options Description     c Bytes   k Kilobytes   M Megabytes   G Gigabytes   b 512-byte blocks     The which command locates the executable file associated with a given command. It returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be executed in the current environment, had the filename (or filenames) been given as a command (or commands) in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell. It does this by searching the paths in the PATH environment variable for executable files matching the names of the arguments.\nThe syntax for which command is as follows:\nwhich [OPTIONS] FILE_NAME Locate File With Which For example, to find the full path of the ping command, you would type the following:\nwhich ping You can also provide more than one arguments to the which command:\nwhich ping uptime The output will include full paths to both ping and uptime executables:\n\/usr\/bin\/ping \/usr\/bin\/uptime The search is done from left to right, and if more than one matches are found in the directories listed in the PATH path variable, which will print only the first one. To print all matches, use the -a option:\nwhich -a touch  Usually one of the executables is only a symlink to the other one, but in some cases, you may have two versions of the same command installed in different locations or different commands using the same name.\n The which command is used to locate a command by searching the command executable in the directories specified by the environmental variable PATH.\n  Showing History Of Used Commands Since all of our services are currently running on Open-Source. There is a very useful command to show you all of the last commands that have been recently used. The command is simply called history, but can also be accessed by looking at your .bash_history in your home folder.\nhistory  By default, the history command will show you the last five hundred commands you have entered.\n Showing History Of Used Command Less If you wish to view the history one page at a time, you can use the command below. Now, you can simply use the spacebar to view one page at a time or use the down arrow to view one line at a time:\nhistory | less To view just the last ten commands, you can use the following:\nhistory | tail To view the last 25 commands, just use the following:\nhistory 25 Another way to search history is with the following command. This command will show us all the history of commands have used on the object.\nhistory | grep \u0026lt;OPTION\u0026gt; \u0026lt;FILE_NAME\u0026gt; For Example: I want to see how many commands have been used on this file text.txt\nhistory | grep text.txt Here is the output all the commands have been used on it.\n 394 touch text.txt 397 find \/ -iname text.txt 398 sudo find \/ -iname text.txt 408 locate text.txt 431 history | grep text.txt  </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",

							value: "System Manager",
							label: "<p>Systemctl is init system and system manager that is widely becoming the new standard for opensource machines. While there are considerable opinions about whether systemd is an improvement over the traditional SysV init systems it is replacing, the majority of distributions plan to adopt it or have already done so.\nDue to its heavy adoption, familiarizing yourself with systemd is well worth the trouble, as it will make administering servers considerably easier. Learning about and utilizing the tools and daemons that comprise systemd will help you better appreciate the power, flexibility, and capabilities it provides, or at least help you to do your job with minimal hassle.\nIn this guide, we will be discussing the systemctl command, which is the central management tool for controlling the init system. We will cover how to manage services, check statuses, change system states, and work with the configuration files.\nPlease note that although systemd has become the default init system for many Linux distributions, it isn’t implemented universally across all distros. As you go through this tutorial, if your terminal outputs the error bash: systemctl is not installed then it is likely that your machine has a different init system installed.\n   System Service Management The fundamental purpose of an init system is to initialize the components that must be started after the Linux kernel is booted (traditionally known as “userland” components). The init system is also used to manage services and daemons for the server at any point while the system is running. With that in mind, we will start with some simple service management operations.\nIn systemd, the target of most actions are “units”, which are resources that systemd knows how to manage. Units are categorized by the type of resource they represent and they are defined with files known as unit files. The type of each unit can be inferred from the suffix on the end of the file.\nFor service management tasks, the target unit will be service units, which have unit files with a suffix of .service. However, for most service management commands, you can actually leave off the .service suffix, as systemd is smart enough to know that you probably want to operate on a service when using service management commands.\nBasic systemctl usage The main command used to introspect and control systemd is systemctl, which has mentioned above. Some of its uses are examining the system state and managing the system and services.\nAnalyzing the system state The commands so far have been useful for managing single services, but they are not very helpful for exploring the current state of the system. There are a number of systemctl commands that provide this information.\nShow system status using:\nsystemctl status List Running Units To see a list of all of the active units that systemd knows about, we can use the list-units command:\nsystemctl list-units Since the list-units command shows only active units by default, all of the entries above will show “loaded” in the LOAD column and “active” in the ACTIVE column. This display is actually the default behavior of systemctl when called without additional commands, so you will see the same thing if you call systemctl with no arguments:\nsystemctl We can tell systemctl to output different information by adding additional flags. For instance, to see all of the units that systemd has loaded (or attempted to load), regardless of whether they are currently active, you can use the --all flag, like this:\nsystemctl list-units --all This will show any unit that systemd loaded or attempted to load, regardless of its current state on the system. Some units become inactive after running, and some units that systemd attempted to load may have not been found on disk.\nList Failed Units systemctl --failed If your output has beedn provided like below, It means that your system does not have any UNIT Failed.\nUNIT LOAD ACTIVE SUB DESCRIPTION 0 loaded units listed. Using Units Start a unit immediately:\nsudo systemctl start \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Sample for starting nginx.service\nsudo systemctl start nginx.service  After you run the command, there will be nothing showing on your desktop. You can check if it really running or not with flag status.\n All the flag are being used the same as sample have been given above.\n Stop a unit immediately:\nsudo systemctl stop \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Restart a unit:\nsudo systemctl restart \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Ask a unit to reload its configuration:\nsudo systemctl reload \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Show the status of a unit, including whether it is running or not:\nsystemctl status \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Check whether a unit is already enabled or not:\nsystemctl is-enabled \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Enable a unit to be started on bootup:\nsudo systemctl enable \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Enable a unit to be started on bootup and Start immediately:\nsudo systemctl enable --now \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Disable a unit to not start during bootup:\nsudo systemctl disable \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Mask a unit to make it impossible to start it (both manually and as a dependency, which makes masking dangerous):\nsudo systemctl mask \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Unmask a unit:\nsudo systemctl unmask \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Show the manual page associated with a unit (this has to be supported by the unit file):\nsystemctl help \u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; Reload systemd manager configuration, scanning for new or changed units: This does not ask the changed units to reload their own configurations. See reload example above.\n systemctl daemon-reload Removing Units To remove any additions you have made, either delete the unit’s .d configuration directory or the modified service file from \/etc\/systemd\/system. For instance, to remove a snippet, we could type:\nsudo rm -r \/etc\/systemd\/system\/\u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; To remove a full modified unit file, we would type:\nsudo rm \/etc\/systemd\/system\/\u0026lt;unit_name\u0026gt; After deleting the file or directory, you should reload the systemd process so that it no longer attempts to reference these files and reverts back to using the system copies. You can do this by typing:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload Getting and Setting the Default Target The systemd process has a default target that it uses when booting the system. Satisfying the cascade of dependencies from that single target will bring the system into the desired state. To find the default target for your system, type:\nsystemctl get-default multi-user.target If you wish to set a different default target, you can use the set-default. For instance, if you have a graphical desktop installed and you wish for the system to boot into that by default, you can change your default target accordingly:\nsudo systemctl set-default graphical.target   </p><p>induct</p><p>instate</p>",
