As in here, for instance:\npi -S \u0026lt;Package group name\u0026gt; To see what inside the package group, run:\npi -Sg \u0026lt;Package group name\u0026gt; Removing Packages If you just want to remove the package, the command following will be enough:\n pi -R \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; To remove the package and those of its dependencies that aren’t needed by any other application, do:\n pi -Rs \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; To remove a package, its dependencies and all the packages that depend on the target package:\n pi -Rsc \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; For deleting a package that other packages need without deleting their dependency package:\n pi -Rdd \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt;  Note: All operations have required a password. Then if you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your operation. {.is-info}\n  Tips: Here Special usage to automate the install procedure (Recommend): {.is-success}\n yes | pi -S \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt;  Tips: Install packages with no confirm {.is-success}\n  pi -S --noconfirm \u0026lt;Package name\u0026gt; Listing Packages You may want to get the list of installed packages with their version, which is useful while reporting bugs or discussing installed packages.\n List all explicitly installed packages: pi -Qe. List all packages in the package group named group: pi -Sg group List all explicitly installed native packages (i.e. present in the sync database) that are not direct or optional dependencies: pi -Qent. List all foreign packages (typically manually downloaded and installed or packages removed from the repositories): pi -Qm. List all native packages (installed from the sync database(s)): pi -Qn. List packages by regex: pi -Qs regex. List packages by regex with custom output format: expac -s \u0026quot;%-30n %v\u0026quot; regex (needs expac).  Listing Changed Backup Files If you want to backup your system configuration files you could copy all files in \/etc\/, but usually, you are only interested in the files that you have changed. Modified backup files can be viewed with the following command:\n pi -Qii | awk \u0027\/^MODIFIED\/ {print $ 2}\u0027 Running this command with root permissions will ensure that files readable only by root (such as \/etc\/sudoers) are included in the output.\nListing All Changed Files From Packages If you are suspecting file corruption (e.g. by software\/hardware failure), but are unsure if files were corrupted, you might want to compare with the hash sums in the packages.\npaccheck --md5sum --quiet Removing Unused Packages (orphans) For recursively removing orphans and their configuration files:\npi -Rns $ (pi -Qtdq) If no orphans were found pacman outputs error: no targets specified. This is expected as no arguments were passed to pi -Rns.\nBackup The Pi Database The following command can be used to back up the local pi database:\n tar -cjf pacman_database.tar.bz2 \/var\/lib\/pacman\/local  Noted: If the pi database files are corrupted, and there is no backup file available, there exists some hope of rebuilding the pi database. {.is-info}\n Reinstalling all packages To reinstall all native packages, use:\npi -Qqn | pi -S - Password Info Both KOOMPI OS and Linux operating systems use the passwd command to change the user password. The passwd is used to update a user’s authentication token (password) stored in \/etc\/shadow file. The passwd change passwords for user and group accounts.\nA normal user may only change the password for his\/her own account, the superuser (or root) may change the password for any account.\nThe administrator of a group may change the password for the group. It also changes account information, such as the full name of the user, user login shell, or password expiry date and interval.\nSet User Password Type the following command to change your own password\n passwd Sample Output:\n [koompi@koompi-pc ~]$ passwd Changing password for koompi. Current password: New password: Retype new password: passwd: password updated successfully The user is first prompted for his\/her old password if one is present. This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password.\nThe superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten passwords may be changed. A new password is tested for complexity. As a general guideline, passwords should consist of 10 to 20 characters including one or more** from each of the following sets:\n Lower case alphabetics Upper case alphabetics Digits 0 to 9 Punctuation marks\/spacial characters  Changing Password For Other User Account You need to log in as the root user. In order to go into the root, type the following command to change the password for User_Name:\npasswd User_Name or\nsudo passwd User_Name Sample Output:\n [koompi@koompi-pc ~]$ sudo passwd koompi New password: Retype new password: passwd: password updated successfully Where, koompi – is username or account\u0026rsquo;s name.\n Noted: Passwords do not display to the screen when you enter them. {.is-info}\n Changing Group Password When the -g option is used, the password for the named group is changed. In this example, change the password for the group:\n passwd -g Group_Name The current group password is not prompted for. The -r option is used with the -g option to remove the current password from the named group. This allows group access to all members. The -R option is used with the -g option to restrict the named group for all users.\nChanging User Passwords On KOOMPI OS As a KOOMPI OS or Linux system administrator (sysadmin), you can change the password for any users on your server. To change a password on behalf of a user:\n First sign on or “su” or “sudo” to the “root” account on KOOMPI OS, run: sudo -i Then type, passwd Administrator_name to change a password for Admin user The system will prompt you to enter a password twice  Conclusion The passwd command line utility is used to update or change user’s password. The encrypted password is stored in \/etc\/shadow file and account information is in \/etc\/passwd file. To see all user account try grep command or cat command as follows:\n cat \/etc\/passwd grep \u0027^userNameHere\u0027 \/etc\/passwd The root account on a KOOMPI OS computer is the account with full privileges. Root access is often necessary for performing commands in PionuxOS, especially commands that affect system files. Because root is so powerful, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to only request root access when necessary, as opposed to logging in as the root user. This can help prevent accidental damage to important system files.\nRoot Info Root Access In Terminal(Konsole)  Open the terminal. If the terminal is not already open, open it. Many distributions allow you to open it by pressing Ctrl\u002bAlt\u002bT. Type su - and press ↵ Enter. This will attempt to log you in as super user. You can actually use this command to log in as any user on the machine, but when left blank it will attempt to log in as root. Enter the root password when prompted. After typing *su - and press ↵ Enter, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted for the root password. If you get an \u0026ldquo;authentication error\u0026rdquo; message, your root account is likely locked. See the next section for instructions on unlocking it. Check the command prompt. When you are logged in as root, the command prompt should end with # instead of $. Now you can use any commands that required root.  Logout Of Root You can Logout of Root in two ways: \u002b First Way, Type:\nexit \u002b Second Way,Press:\n CTRL\u002bD Unlocked The Root Account  Unlock the root account (KOOMPI OS). KOOMPI OS locks the root account so that the average user can\u0026rsquo;t access it. This is done because accessing root is rarely necessary when using the sudo command (see the previous section). Unlocking the root account will allow you to log in as root.  sudo passwd root Open the terminal. If the terminal hasn\u0026rsquo;t opened yet. Many distributions allow you to open it by pressing Ctrl\u002bAlt\u002bT. Type sudo passwd root and press ↵ Enter. When prompted for a password, enter your user password. Set a new password. You\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to create a new password and enter it twice. Once a password has been set, the root account will be active. Lock the root account again. If you want to lock the root account, enter the following commands to remove the password and lock root:   sudo passwd -dl root Querying Package Database $ pi -Q #queries the local package database $ pi -s #sync database $ pi -F #files database For more options about querying:\n$ pi -Q --help Options:\n-b, --dbpath \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; # set an alternate database location -c, --changelog # view the changelog of a package -d, --deps # list packages installed as dependencies [filter] -e, --explicit # list packages explicitly installed [filter] -g, --groups # view all members of a package group -i, --info # view package information (-ii for backup files) -k, --check # check that package files exist (-kk for file properties) -l, --list # list the files owned by the queried package -m, --foreign # list installed packages not found in sync db(s) [filter] -n, --native # list installed packages only found in sync db(s) [filter] -o, --owns \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; # query the package that owns \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; -p, --file \u0026lt;package\u0026gt; # query a package file instead of the database -q, --quiet # show less information for query and search -r, --root \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; # set an alternate installation root -s, --search \u0026lt;regex\u0026gt; # search locally-installed packages for matching strings -t, --unrequired # list packages not (optionally) required by any package (-tt to ignore optdepends) [filter] -u, --upgrades # list outdated packages [filter] -v, --verbose # be verbose --arch \u0026lt;arch\u0026gt; # set an alternate architecture --cachedir \u0026lt;dir\u0026gt; # set an alternate package cache location --color \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; # colorize the output --config \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; # set an alternate configuration file --confirm # always ask for confirmation --debug # display debug messages --disable-download-timeout # use relaxed timeouts for download --gpgdir \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; # set an alternate home directory for GnuPG --hookdir \u0026lt;dir\u0026gt; # set an alternate hook location --logfile \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; # set an alternate log file --noconfirm # do not ask for any confirmation --sysroot # operate on a mounted guest system (root-only)  Warning: Sometimes, -s\u0026rsquo;s builtin ERE (Extended Regular Expressions) can cause a lot of unwanted results, so it has to be limited to match the package name only; not the description nor any other field. {.is-warning}\n Searching Packages Pi can also use for the search for packages in the database (package_name and descriptions):\npi -Ss String Example :\npi -Ss \u0027^vim-\u0027 To Search for installed package:\npi -Qs String1 String2 ... To display extensive information about the given packages:\n pi -F String1 String2  Tips: Passing two -i flags will also display the list of backup files and their modification states. {.is-success}\n  $ pi -Qii package_name To verify the presence of the files installed by a package:\n $ pi -Qk package_name  Tips: Passing the k flag twice will perform a more thorough check. {.is-success}\n Cleaning The Package Caches Pi stores its downloaded packages in \/var\/cache\/pacman\/pkg\/ and does not remove the old or uninstalled versions automatically. This has some advantages:\n1. It allows to downgrade a package without the need to retrieve the previous version through other means, such as the Arch Linux Archive. 2. A package that has been uninstalled can easily be reinstalled directly from the cache folder, not requiring a new download from the repository.\nHowever, it is necessary to deliberately clean up the cache periodically to prevent the folder to grow indefinitely in size.\nThe paccache script, provided within the pacman-contrib package, deletes all cached versions of installed and uninstalled packages, except for the most recent 3, by default:\npaccache -r Enable and start paccache.timer to discard unused packages weekly.\n Tips: You can create a hook to run this automatically after every pi transaction. {.is-success}\n For more options aboout paccache use :\n paccache -h Pacman also has some built-in options to clean the cache and the leftover database files from repositories which are no longer listed in the configuration file \/etc\/pacman.conf.\nHowever, Pacman does not offer the possibility to keep a number of past versions and is, therefore, more aggressive than paccache default options.\nTo remove all the cached packages that are not currently installed, and the unused sync database, execute:\n pi -Sc To remove all files from the cache, use the clean switch twice, this is the most aggressive approach and will leave nothing in the cache folder:\n pi -Scc  Warning: One should avoid deleting from the cache all past versions of installed packages and all uninstalled packages unless one desperately needs to free some disk space. This will prevent downgrading or reinstalling packages without downloading them again. {.is-warning}\n  Tips: Automatically clean the package cache. {.is-success}\n If you are too lazy to clean the package cache manually, you can automate this task using Pacman hooks. The Pacman hook will automatically clean the package cache after every Pacman transaction.\nTo do so, create a file \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks\/clean_package_cache.hook:\nsudo mkdir \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks Next:\nsudo nano \/etc\/pacman.d\/hooks\/clean_package_cache.hook Add the following lines:\n[Trigger] Operation = Upgrade Operation = Install Operation = Remove Type = Package Target = * [Action] Description = Cleaning pacman cache... When = PostTransaction Exec = \/usr\/bin\/paccache -r Save and close the file. From now on, the package cache will be cleaned automatically after every Pacman transactions (like an upgrade, install, remove). You don’t have to run paccache command manually every time.\nOther Operations Operations:\n$ pi {-h --help} $ pi {-V --version} $ pi {-D --database} # \u0026lt;options\u0026gt; \u0026lt;package(s)\u0026gt;
