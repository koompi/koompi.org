 User name and real user ID Name of the user&amp;rsquo;s group and real group ID Name of user&amp;rsquo;s supplementary groups and supplementary group IDs  Supplementary group information is written only for systems supporting multiple-user groups and only if the specified user belongs to a supplementary group.</description>

      <description>root is the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system with full privileges. Root access is often necessary for performing commands in the system, especially commands that affect system files because root is so powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to only request root access when necessary, as opposed to logging in as the root user. This can help prevent accidental damage to important system files.</description>

      <description>Pi stores its downloaded packages in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ and does not remove the old or uninstalled versions automatically. This has some advantages:
 It allows to downgrade a package without the need to retrieve the previous version through other means, such as the Arch Linux Archive. A package that has been uninstalled can easily be reinstalled directly from the cache folder, not requiring a new download from the repository.  However, it is necessary to deliberately clean up the cache periodically to prevent the folder to grow indefinitely in size.</description>

      <description>Systemctl is init system and system manager that is widely becoming the new standard for opensource machines. While there are considerable opinions about whether systemd is an improvement over the traditional SysV init systems it is replacing, the majority of distributions plan to adopt it or have already done so.
Due to its heavy adoption, familiarizing yourself with systemd is well worth the trouble, as it will make administering servers considerably easier.</description>

      <description>Coming soon!! **Noted**: If the **pi** database files are corrupted, and there is no backup file available, there exists some hope of rebuilding the pi database. {.is-info} # Reinstalling all packages To reinstall all native packages, use: ```shell pi -Qqn | pi -S - ``` # Querying Package Database ```shell $ pi -Q #queries the local package database $ pi -s #sync database $ pi -F #files database ``` For more options about querying: ```shell $ pi -Q --help ``` Options: ```shell -b, --dbpath  # set an alternate database location -c, --changelog # view the changelog of a package -d, --deps # list packages installed as dependencies [filter] -e, --explicit # list packages explicitly installed [filter] -g, --groups # view all members of a package group -i, --info # view package information (-ii for backup files) -k, --check # check that package files exist (-kk for file properties) -l, --list # list the files owned by the queried package -m, --foreign # list installed packages not found in sync db(s) [filter] -n, --native # list installed packages only found in sync db(s) [filter] -o, --owns  # query the package that owns  -p, --file  # query a package file instead of the database -q, --quiet # show less information for query and search -r, --root  # set an alternate installation root -s, --search  # search locally-installed packages for matching strings -t, --unrequired # list packages not (optionally) required by any package (-tt to ignore optdepends) [filter] -u, --upgrades # list outdated packages [filter] -v, --verbose # be verbose --arch  # set an alternate architecture --cachedir  # set an alternate package cache location --color  # colorize the output --config  # set an alternate configuration file --confirm # always ask for confirmation --debug # display debug messages --disable-download-timeout # use relaxed timeouts for download --gpgdir  # set an alternate home directory for GnuPG --hookdir  # set an alternate hook location --logfile  # set an alternate log file --noconfirm # do not ask for any confirmation --sysroot # operate on a mounted guest system (root-only) ```  **Warning**: Sometimes, -s&#39;s builtin ERE (Extended Regular Expressions) can cause a lot of unwanted results, so it has to be limited to match the package name only; not the description nor any other field.</description>
