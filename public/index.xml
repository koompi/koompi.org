      <description>root is the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system with full privileges. Root access is often necessary for performing commands in the system, especially commands that affect system files because root is so powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to only request root access when necessary, as opposed to logging in as the root user. This can help prevent accidental damage to important system files.</description>

      <description>A web browser, or simply &amp;ldquo;browser,&amp;rdquo; is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the screen.
The most popular browsers have several features in common. They allow users to set bookmarks and browse in a private mode. They also can be customized with extensions, and some of them provide a sync service.</description>

      <description>Pi stores its downloaded packages in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ and does not remove the old or uninstalled versions automatically. This has some advantages:
 It allows to downgrade a package without the need to retrieve the previous version through other means, such as the Arch Linux Archive. A package that has been uninstalled can easily be reinstalled directly from the cache folder, not requiring a new download from the repository.  However, it is necessary to deliberately clean up the cache periodically to prevent the folder to grow indefinitely in size.</description>
